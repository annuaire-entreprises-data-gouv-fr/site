            *This PR is automatically generated by a bot.*
            It updates the snapshots of the API clients.

            Review carefully the changes to see if there is no regression:
            - No changes in attributes names
            - No suspect massive changes in the data
            - No changes in the structure of the data

            If everything looks good, you can merge this PR. 

            Otherwise, you should take action to fix the issue, by either: 
            - Contact the administration responsible for the API
            - Change the client code to adapt to the new data
